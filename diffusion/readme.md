# Diffusion Simulation

This repository contains code for simulating the diffusion of particles in a 2D environment. The simulation is implemented in Python and uses matplotlib for visualization.

## Overview

Diffusion is a process by which particles spread out from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. It is a fundamental phenomenon in various scientific fields including physics, chemistry, and biology.

In this simulation, we model the diffusion of particles within a square grid. The particles start from an initial confined state and undergo random motion in each timestep. The simulation provides visual insights into how particles disperse over time.

## Features

- Particle diffusion in a 2D environment.
- Visualization of particle movement.
- Entropy calculation for tracking system disorder.
- Restarting the simulation after a specified number of timesteps.
